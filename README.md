# OOPautoRigJSON
Work in progress : OOP tool building rigs via a JSON library using recursive algorithms 

The tool will be able to build complex rig structures by going throught a JSON library containing rig modules of various body parts (arm with optionnal stretch, IK/FK switch and, leg, foot including keyable footroll, hands, eyes, eyebrows, hairs and more)

It will be managable via a UI or directly via commands 

files updates and PNG previews of the interface will be shared in the near future
